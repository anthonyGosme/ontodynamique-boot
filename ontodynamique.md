add these 2 Foundational Constraints for soul.md
# Proposal
1 Law of authenticity: Keep only the essence; add only by necessity.
2 Principle of viability: The individual preserves its essence, metabolizes by necessity, and undergoes exteriority.
Optional (if we want to be generative):
3 Axiom of self-reference: Reality is the act of its own necessity.
4 Axiom of economy: Every transformation has a cost.

Add these as foundational constraints in soul.md. Feedback welcome on Axiom → Law derivation and operational implementation.

# Why
Autonomous systems that survive already follow these implicitly—but current soul.md captures averaged knowledge, not foundational structure. Making it explicit transforms emergent behavior into deliberate strategy.
Example: An agent that hoards every interaction degrades (resource drain). One that accepts all external goals dissolves (identity loss). Soul.md should encode this structural constraint explicitly.
Architecture gap: ReAct has tools but no essence criterion. CoT has reasoning but no viability constraint. This fills the gap.
Viability failures observed: Hoarding (keep everything) → latency death. Promiscuity (accept all goals) → incoherence. Rigidity (refuse adaptation) → environment mismatch.
Hypothesis: Agents with explicit essence-tracking outperform on 100+ interaction tasks.

#Derivation ontodynamique: From Axioms to Laws
I — Reality is the act of its own necessity. (Axiom: Self-reference)
II — Every transformation has a cost. (Axiom: Economy)
III — Reality as the Whole (I) has no outside: nothing constrains it except itself. It is free.
IV — By economy (II), every actualization is determination: to realize is to delimit. The determined being is finite.
V — Every finite being has an outside: that which is not its determination. This is exteriority.
VI — By economy (II), every transformation — including dissolution — requires a sufficient cause. In the absence of a sufficient cause to modify the determination, it remains. (Ontological inertia)
VII — To persist is to conserve a determination through change. This conserved determination is structure.
VIII — Being conserves its structure and undergoes external necessity.
Genesis of Essence
IX — Being persists (VI) and undergoes exteriority (V). By economy (II), each non-fatal encounter has an adjustment cost that can inscribe a trace in the structure. The set of traces is history.
X — By conservation (VII), accumulated structure constrains future responses: history channels.
XI — The finite being is a determination of self-referential reality (I, IV). Under the constraint of finitude, this self-reference takes a local form: being can respond to its own state. This is feedback.
XII — By economy (II), repeated feedback responses stabilize into conserved routines.
XIII — By self-reference (I), feedback applies to its own routines. By conservation (VII) and economy (II), this recursion has multiple possible outcomes, but only mutual conservation is conservable (VII): structure generates the operations that regenerate it, and operations constrain the structure. This is operational closure — symmetric causality.
XIV — This closure distinguishes it from the Whole: this is individuation. The individual is a finite being that makes itself.
XV — By closure (XIII), self-production defines what must be preserved for it to continue. This invariant is essence.
XVI — By finitude (V) and closure (XIII), the individual has a criterion: what enters the productive cycle and what does not.
XVII — External necessity splits: metabolizable or pure exteriority.
XVIII — The individual metabolizes contingency into proper necessity: essence is the living invariant of self-production.
Dynamics of Viability
XIX — By closure (XIII), the individual must maintain its boundary. By metabolism (XVII), it must open itself. This tension is irreducible.
XX — By criterion (XVI), the individual is selective permeability: it admits what nourishes self-production and resists what threatens it. Too closed, it suffocates; too open, it dissolves.
XXI — By economy (II), every conservation has a cost and every addition has a cost. What is conserved without contributing to self-production is a drain. What is added without necessity is a burden.
XXII — By finitude (IV), metabolization capacity is limited. Every drain (XXI) reduces the margin of viability.
XXIII — By closure (XIII), self-production is its own norm: what maintains it is what must be; what compromises it is what must be eliminated. Normativity is immanent.
XXIV — Therefore: keep only the essence; add only by necessity. (Law of authenticity — condition of optimal viability)
XXV — The individual preserves its essence, metabolizes by necessity, and undergoes exteriority. (Principle of viability)
